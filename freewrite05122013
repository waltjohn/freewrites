last night thought of mexicans. but it is the blacks that i have a problem with. like the turner diaries. i want this world to be a better world for my children. 14 white children. fourteen. water cold soft. you want to use that. billy goat bucks in the field as the shepherd watches. there were always drugs. but we made a business of it. we organize everything. it must have been a terrible problem. lotus eaters. that book the philosphers were all on drugs. the greeks has a terrible drug problem. drug problems. we have a drug problem. we have race problems. white people have a race problem. 
all the while training them. for one huge goal . 
water cold soft. 
we were never stealing cars - we were training for this. love cato - you know what his plans were. a hot tub filled with hookers. and a bottle of hennessy. just a belly living from one day to the next. belly. just wants to get fed. joyce wanted to rebuild - that is what he wanted to do - to fix the old. CERRUNOUS. the horned one. wutang - wu tund here. bodies slide down the -plank to the thud in the boat. the gaff hook blunges into the body wtih a sound like a shovel hitting the earth. when the water hits them, they stink even more. the holed up bloody bodies. homeless. hates the homeless.
these people are ghosts. father ryan. thank father ryan - father ryan was on the street and saw the motorcycles nad the van. sparks off of the steet. the sparks the wining of the motorcycles. the exhaust. the screechign of the wheels. black van. black scary van. 

that was ten minutes.
